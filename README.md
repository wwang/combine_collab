README

Overview:

    This script (combine.sh) is designed for University of Virginia Collab system. This script processes the bulk_download.zip file from Collab, reads in student submitted attachments, converts these attachments to pdf files, and combines the generated pdf files into one pdf file for printing.

Usage:

    bash combine.sh /path/to/bulk_download.zip

    The final pdf is called "combined.pdf", and is generated under the same directory of combine.sh

Converting Images:
    
    This script uses "convert" from imagemagick to convert images to pdf. Although imagemagick should support almost all image file types, this script only tested with limited types of files. To add more image file types, simply add the extension name of that file type to array "allowed_img_files". 

Converting MS Word files:

    This script uses LibreOffice and pyodconverter.


Misc:

    Ghostscript will throw out warnings when student submitted pdf file does not follow Adobe's standard (like those generated by MS Office). However, these warnings do not affect the processing of these not-so-standard pdf files.
    Tested on UVa CS power servers (Ubuntu 14.04)
